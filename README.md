# Keys

Login to WIX and then goto account settings and API Keys and create a key. Copy the Token it generates and copy that into your .env file in the `API_KEY` field.

Then goto your wix site and from the URL figure out the site id (it's a UUID in the URL). Copy that into the `SITE_ID` field in your .env file.
